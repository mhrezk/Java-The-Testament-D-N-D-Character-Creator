# The Testament: D&D 5th Edition Character Creator

## Description

An application designed to automate the creation of a tabletop role-playing character for D&D 5th Edition. The program is still in current development, but certain functionalities are available. The purpose behind the creation of such an application is to provide a program that can be accessed offline, without suffering through connectivty issues. In addition, players can access the content of D&D within it freely, without the restrictions of subscriptions, memberships and payment walls. 

NOTE: The design of the application was not fully considered during development; it will be changed after the entirety of the remaining functionalities are added and implemented, God willing.

## Contents

### EXECUTABLE FILE

- [x] `D&D Character Creator`: The executable file for starting the application. Installation is not required.

## Usage

The application is openly available to whomever wishes to use it. A repository containing the source code will be uploaded later, God willing, if people wish to contribute to the project.
